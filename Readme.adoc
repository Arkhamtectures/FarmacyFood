This is an Architecture proposal by Arkhamtectures Team to enhance existing https://github.com/ldynia/archcolider[Farmacy Foods] to further their customer engagement.

== Overview

Primary goals

* develop relationships between <<engaged-customer, engaged customers>> and nurture those relationships
* convert transactional customers to <<engaged-customer, engaged customers>>
* generate analytical data from medical information to demonstrate the benefits of Farmacy Foods

When a transactional customer purchases a meal, Farmacy Family will generate an email elucidating additional benefits available for becoming an <<engaged-customer, engaged customer>>.

Thus, the overall goal of Farmacy Family is to connect, gather, analyze, and communicate.

=== Definitions

[#transactional-customer]
. Transactional Customer: Customer of FFoods
[#engaged-customer]
. Engaged Customer - Customer of both FFamily and FFoods
[#support-community]
. Support Community - Engaged members within a <<community>>
[#client]
. Client: low income, poverty level, homeless, college students, educators, senior citizens
[#community]
. Community - small group of <<engaged-customer, engaged customers>> within a neighborhood area

This is another paragraph.footnote:[I am footnote text and will be displayed at the bottom of the article.]

== Requirements

* Add a new system to manage customer profiles, allowing <<community>> engagement, personalization around preferences and dietary needs.
* Support geographical trend analysis to hone Farmacy Familyâ€™s ability to optimize the foods delivered to fridges (an additional integration point To Farmacy Foods).
* Support both push and pull models for <<community>> engagement. In other words, Farmacy Family will manage forums, emails, and create connections between similar demographics. Farmacy Family needs <<transactional-customer, Transactional Customer>> information for outreach purposes. The engagement model includes subscriptions, forums, reference material, class information, and other media that supports Food-as-medicine.
* eDietian has access to customer profile to improve advice and monitoring of customers. Additionally, the customer and dietitian can interact via messages.
* Farmacy Family wants to improve the distribution and potential food waste from having the wrong mix of foods in a particular fridge.
* Farmacy Family will include medical profile information and the ability to share information with medical service providers.
* Farmacy Family customers can customize how much profile information they want to allow the <<community>> to see, at a fine-grained level.
* Farmacy Family has relationships with third party providers (clinics, doctors, etc) that have access to more analytical data to improve engagement (for example, regional dietary observations).
* Add Farmacy Family user interface to existing Foods interface, which is currently a Reactive monolith. Create a holistic UX for both food and Farmacy Family to support engagement model.
