= 003 Event Stream

Date: 2021-11-01

== Status

Proposed

== Context

The analytics sub-system requires a reliable and scalable event stream that enables batching of events before they are processed. Events from EventBridge can be delivered to a target like AWS Lambda function one at a time. Without batching, the costs will be huge. 

== Decision

We will go with AWS Kinesis Stream for event streams in the analytics sub-system architecture. There will be 2 event stream to begin with - one for analytics and one for notification. 

== Consequences

*Positive:* Events can be batched which will drive down costs. Event can be batched by partition-key (which can be the event type or customer id). We can have back-pressure in the streams to control how to balance speed vs cost.

*Negative:*

*Risks:* 

*Bonus Features:*
